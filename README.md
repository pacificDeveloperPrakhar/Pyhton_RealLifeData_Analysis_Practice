# Jupyter Notebook with Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and IPykernel

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate the usage of essential data science and machine learning libraries including Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and IPykernel.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You also need a package manager like `pip` or `conda` to install the required dependencies.

## Libraries Used

- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures like DataFrames, enabling easy handling of structured data.
- **Numpy**: A library for handling numerical operations and multidimensional arrays efficiently.
- **IPykernel**: A Jupyter kernel to run Python code in Jupyter Notebook.

These libraries are specified in the `packages.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Packages

First, install the required packages listed in the `packages.txt` file. You can do this using the `pip` command as follows:

```bash
pip install -r packages.txt
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies for this project isolated. You can use either `conda` or `python venv` to set up the environment.

#### Using Conda

1. **Create a new Conda environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.x
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.x` with the version of Python you need.

2. **Activate the environment:**

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

3. **Install packages into the Conda environment:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r packages.txt
   ```

#### Using Python `venv`

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a virtual environment in a folder named `venv`.

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install packages in the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r packages.txt
   ```

### 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

Once the environment is set up and the necessary packages are installed, start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser, where you can navigate to your notebook file and begin running your code.

### 4. Deactivating the Environment

- To deactivate the virtual environment after you’re done:
  
  - For **Conda**:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```

  - For **venv**:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

---

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional environment to run your Jupyter Notebook with all required libraries properly installed.
